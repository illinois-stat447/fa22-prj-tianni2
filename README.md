Data: The dataset for this project would be the bike-sharing dataset coming from UCI,https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset. The dataset contained hourly and daily collected count of rental bikes from bike rental systems records of 2011-2022. More than that, it also contains temperature, humidity, whether its weekend/weekday/holiday, wind speed and other factors which may think of as influencers of rental bike count. 

Target: Main target of this project is to investigate most important factors which might influence the count of rental bikes and their effect. 

Process: ain process might be, data visualization -- data preprocessing -- data visualization -- model training -- results integration. 

(I will lately upload the dataset I would use for this project and also the readme.md of the dataset which include the data info and attribute details for better understanding.)
